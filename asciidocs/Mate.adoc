= Installation

Install https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/[Anaconda] or https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html[Miniconda].
You might need to execute `chmod +x ./Miniconda-#version#` if you don't have permission to run the script.

Execute `conda env create -f environment.yml` in this directory.

= Execution
Run `./start.sh`

== Legacy way (use if other one is not working)
Before running execute `conda activate MateEnv`.

Run Mate with `python run.py`.

= Connect to SimRobot
SimRobot creates a socket-file (Can be opened exactly like a proper Socket, and behaves exactly the same as normal network-sockets are also treated as files by linux) for every Simulated Robot. These files are located at:
`/tmp/simrobot/[robotname]`. eg: `/tmp/simrobot/robot2`
