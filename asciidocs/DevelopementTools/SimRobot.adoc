The SimRobot is a tool to simulate specific scenarios in the soccer game. Keep in mind the SimRobot environment is a perfect Condition for the robots. In the real life some things may be differently than in the SimRobot. Everything is required to get tested in the real-life environment before merging into develop.

== How to use the SimRobot
Every command will be executed in the root directory of the project.

=== Setup for the SimRobot

[source,shell]
----
./scripts/midas setup sim
----

=== Compile for the SimRobot

[source,shell]
----
./scripts/midas compile develop sim
----

=== Start the SimRobot

[source,shell]
----
./tools/SimRobot/build/SimRobot
----

After this command a window will open. In this window you need to select a scene.

== Scenes
Scenes can be different scenarious. Like one Robot alone on the small field or 4 Robots together on the small field. The different scenes are xml Files. Those xml files define where everything is located.

== Configuring simulated Robots
You can find the same configuration found in real-life under `home/configuration/location/simrobot`. The different robot configurations are in the head directory. There should be different folders like.

To find out which robot you are using in the SimRobot look into the xml file and search for something like this:

[source,xml]
----
<Body ref="Nao" name="robot3">
    <Translation x="-1" y="3" z="320mm"/>
    <Rotation z="-90degree"/>
</Body>
----

In this scenario robot3 is the robot in the Simulation. If you change the configuration in the robot3 directory then the robot in the simulation has other configurations.

== Debugging a specific role with the SimRobot

Find the Configuration folder for the robot you use in the Simmulation and open the `DucksPlayingRoleProvider.json` file. If the file does not exist just create it. The standard content for this configuration looks like this.

[source,json]
----
{
  "forceRole": "none"
}
----

To change the role for the robot in the SimRobot replace the value none with the wished role. For example:

[source,json]
----
{
  "forceRole": "striker"
}
----
