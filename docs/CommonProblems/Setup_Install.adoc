= Setup fails

It can occur that the install.sh script fails on a virtual machine during toolchain compilation. This might be due to the fact that the
virtual machine only has a single CPU-core assigned.

Solution for Virtualbox:

* Open Virtualbox
* Select the machine -> Settings
* Under Settings go to System -> Processor
* Increase the amount of Processor(s) to at least 2 CPUs
* Restart machine
